Hackathon Day 3 Complete! 
Today’s journey was all about API Integration and Data Migration—taking another step closer to building a functional and dynamic marketplace backend. 

🔍 What I Accomplished:
1️⃣ Tested API endpoints from Hackathon API using Postman.
2️⃣ Transformed and migrated the external API data into Sanity CMS, ensuring seamless backend integration.
3️⃣ Enhanced the Sanity schema with additional fields like tags, dimensions, and categories, and created dynamic references between products and categories.
4️⃣ Successfully imported product images using the Sanity Asset Manager, resolving challenges like large file handling with buffered uploads.
5️⃣ Rendered the migrated data on the frontend for a fully functional view!

💡 Key Learnings:
Leveraged axios for fetching external data and slugify for clean slugs.
Developed reusable backend functions for optimized queries, such as fetching all products, popular items, and detailed product views by slug.
Overcame schema mismatches and ensured data integrity with detailed validation checks.

⚡️ Challenges Overcome:
Managed large image files during migration.
Mapped and transformed complex API fields to the Sanity schema.
Batched requests for efficiency and error-free imports.

✅ The Result:
A backend ready to support a dynamic marketplace!
Seamlessly imported and verified data in Sanity CMS Studio, now live and rendering accurately in the frontend.

✨ Next Steps:
Automating schema validation, setting up detailed logging, and exploring real-time data syncing with Sanity webhooks to make this system even more robust.
